<br>Hi,

My name is Jo√£o Oliveira, I'm a Software Engineer and Graphic Designer, with an interest in cybersecurity. I'm currently based in Porto, Portugal.

I studied Multimedia in college, and immediately after finishing I worked for 6 years in graphic design, mainly for hotel groups like Intercontinental, Ibis, Six Senses, Sofitel, IHG,... quickly mastered Photoshop/Illustrator and Digital/Offset machines. Decided that this area didn't value my skills and started studying programming.

I completed the piscine and I'm currently studying the Common Core at 42 Porto, where I have a solid foundation in human and technical skills, C/C++ programming, classic algorithms, file system access, UNIX process management, basic network architecture, system administration, exploring object-oriented programming and tackling a client-server project.

I'm a dedicated professional, I'm known for my strong organization, documentation skills, effective time management, and collaborative teamwork. I'm action-oriented and always eager to learn.

In my spare time, I like to play games, watch anime, snowboarding, 3d printing and also gardening (especially trees).
