Hi,

My name is Jo√£o Oliveira and I'm currently studying the Common Core at 42 Porto. I'm a dedicated professional with experience in programming, graphic design, and web development. My primary areas of focus are cybersecurity and data analysis. I'm known for my strong organization and documentation skills, effective time management, and collaborative teamwork. I'm action-oriented and always eager to learn.

On my spare time I like to play games, watch anime, snowboarding, 3d printing and also gardening (especially trees).
