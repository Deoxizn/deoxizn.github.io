<br>Hi,

My name's Devi Garcia, a certified computer technician with a keen interest in cybersecurity. Currently based in Arizona.

My journey began with a Certificate in Comptia A+, On top of many homelab projects and further learning and progressing into other certifications. As Well as community helping with Local Linux Group (Cochise Linux User Group)

I am currently studying to get my Security+, Network+, as well as going for Pentest+. As Well wanting to learn to program in python and other coding languages as i go along the way.

As a professional, I'm recognized for my strong organizational skills, meticulous documentation practices, efficient time management, and collaborative approach to teamwork. I'm action-oriented and always eager to expand my horizons through continuous learning.

Outside of work and study, I enjoy gaming, watching anime, movies and TV shows. I'm also passionate about playing with technology in general like my own personal homelab. Like breaking it and fixing it or just upgrading it to its max potential.
