<br>Hi,

My name's João Oliveira, and I'm a Software Engineer and Graphic Designer with a keen interest in cybersecurity. Currently, I'm based in Porto, Portugal.

My journey began with a degree in Multimedia, which led me into the world of graphic design. Over six years, I honed my craft, working with prestigious hotel groups like Intercontinental, Ibis, Six Senses, IHG, and more. During this time, I became proficient in Photoshop, Illustrator, and navigated both digital and offset printing processes. However, the design field didn't fully utilize my potential, so I decided to pivot towards programming.

My transition led me to 42 Porto, where I completed the piscine and am now immersed in the Common Core curriculum. Here, I've gained a solid foundation in both technical and interpersonal skills. From mastering C/C++ programming to delving into classic algorithms, file system access, UNIX process management, and basic network architecture. Additionally, I've explored object-oriented programming and tackled challenging client-server projects, expanding my knowledge and expertise.

As a professional, I'm recognized for my strong organizational skills, meticulous documentation practices, efficient time management, and collaborative approach to teamwork. I'm action-oriented and always eager to expand my horizons through continuous learning.

Outside of work and study, I enjoy indulging in my hobbies. From gaming and watching anime to snowboarding adventures. I'm also passionate about 3D printing and gardening, particularly nurturing trees—an activity that brings me closer to nature and provides a peaceful escape from the digital world.
