<br>Hi,

I’m Devi Garcia, a certified computer technician based in Arizona with a growing focus on cybersecurity.


I started my journey by earning my CompTIA A+ certification and building hands-on experience through homelab projects and independent learning. I also enjoy giving back to the community by helping with the Cochise Linux User Group, where I assist others with Linux systems and general tech troubleshooting.


I’m currently studying for my Security+ and Network+ certifications and plan to continue toward PenTest+. Along the way, I’m also learning Python and other programming languages to expand my technical skill set.


I’m known for being highly organized, detail-oriented, and a strong team player. I take pride in good documentation, efficient time management, and staying proactive when it comes to learning and problem-solving.


When I’m not working or studying, you’ll usually find me gaming, watching anime, or experimenting in my homelab — breaking things, fixing them, and upgrading systems just to see how far I can push them.


Feel free to check out the links below to learn more about my work and projects.
